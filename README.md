This project proposes a novel approach that combines RSA-based encryption and optical steganography for secure communication in 5G networks. RSA encryption ensures confidentiality by encrypting the plaintext message with the recipient's public key, while optical steganography conceals the encrypted message within cover images. The resulting stego-images are indistinguishable from the original cover images, preserving the privacy and integrity of the hidden data during transmission. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach, showcasing secure communication with low detection rates and minimal impact on system performance. This technique offers a promising solution for confidentiality, integrity, and privacy in transmitting sensitive information over 5G networks.
